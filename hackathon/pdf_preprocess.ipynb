       " 'ABSTRACT': 'Detection of minor faults in power transformer active part is essential because minor  faults may develop and lead to major faults and finally irretrievable damages occur. Sweep  Frequency Response Analysis (SFRA) is an effective low-voltage, off-line diagnostic tool used  for finding out any possible winding displacement or mechanical deterioration inside the  transformer which happens due to large electromechanical forces occurring from the fault  currents or due to transformer transportation and relocation. In this method, the frequency  response of a transformer is taken both at manufacturing industry and concern site. Then both the  response is compared to predict the fault which has occurred in the active part of transformer.  But in old aged transformers, the primary reference response is unavailable. So, Cross  Correlation Co-Efficient (CCF) measurement technique can be a new approach for fault  detection in these transformers. In this thesis, mathematical analysis of transfer function for  SFRA technique has been elaborated, mathematical model for calculating CCF between SFRA  curves has been programmed and through several case studies, the developed model has been  applied on some faulty transformer. It has been found that theoretically predicted results using  CCF matches with practical results which indicate the effectiveness of the newly proposed  method. The case studies are based on several 132 kV & 230 kV healthy and faulty power  transformers manufactured by Bangladesh, China, India and England.    v',\n",

       " 'General Consideration': 'Nowadays, reliability is an inevitable part of power system studies and operation, due to  significant increase in the number of industrial electrical consumers. Power transformer is one of  the major and critical elements in power system [1] in the area of reliability issue, since their  outage may result in costly and time-consuming repair and replacement. Power transformers are  specified to withstand the mechanical forces arising from both shipping and subsequent in- service events, such as faults and lightning. Once a transformer is damaged either heavily or  slightly, the ability to withstand further incidents or short circuit test [2] becomes reduced. There  is clearly a need to effectively identify such damage. A visual inspection is costly and does not  always produce the desired results or conclusion [3]-[5]. During a field inspection, the oil has to  be drained and confined space entry rules apply. Often, a complete tear down is required to  identify the problem. An alternative method is to implement field-diagnostic techniques that are  capable of detecting damage such as Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) [6].    Deregulation of the power distribution industry in recent years has lead to strategies for  optimizations of the power networks. As a consequence, the operating stress levels in the  networks are closer to the transformers withstand levels [7]-[9] and the amounts of spare  capacity in the networks are decreasing. This has lead to increased quality demands on the  transformer manufacturers, and an incentive for established transformer assessment routines in  the power industry.    In case of Bangladesh power sector, it is mostly a large amount of older equipment that causes  increasing interest in efficient assessment methods. Another factor is that new transformers are  more optimized and thus more sensitive, which also gives reason for systematical assessment  routines [1].    One increasingly important method for transformer condition monitoring is Sweep Frequency  Response Analysis (SFRA). SFRA can be used to detect internal damages in a transformer, for  2    example winding displacements [10]. In operational transformers such damages can be the result  of external short-circuits. Other possible causes of damage are incidents during transportation of  new or serviced units and aging processes, the latter which for example affect winding  insulation. Common to the internal damages that is detectable [11]-[14] by SFRA is their  influence on electrical parameters of the transformer windings. For example a displacement of a  winding will affect stray capacitances, between wounds and to surrounding structures (tank, core  etc.). Such changes are detectable by SFRA and thus possible to detect without dismantling of  the transformer [15].',\n",
       " 'Review of Literature': 'Frequency Response measurements were first investigated in depth by Dick and Erven at Ontario  Hydro in Canada in the 1970‚Äòs. For some reason, their work was never accepted widely. In the  1980‚Äòs the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) in the UK took up the measurement  technique and applied it to transmission transformers. The French also began to pursue  measurements at the same time. On the break-up of the CEGB in the early 1990‚Äòs work in  Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) was taken up by National Grid in the UK and resulted in  several papers at Doble Client Conferences. The technique has been spread further through Euro- Doble conferences and client meetings and several utilities took up the technique.    As the basic technique developed by early users required laboratory based equipment such as HP  network analyzers, which were robust, but not field hardened and required specialist operators.  Upon a successful program of product development and field trials, Doble stepped in to provide  field engineers and staff with a reliable and robust tool for transformer analysis ‚Äì the M5100.  This outperforms the HP in terms of measurement characteristics and field usability.    There are basically two techniques used for FRA measurements on power transformers; Low  Voltage Impulse (LVI) based FRA and Sweep Frequency Response Analysis (SFRA) [16]. The  two techniques are also termed FRA-I (Impulse method) and FRA-S (Swept-frequency method)  [17]. The common strategy for both methods [18] is that the transformer impedance is measured  at several different frequencies. The impedance will vary from one frequency to another due to  the internal constitution of the transformer.    3    LVI is based on that a low voltage impulse is injected into a transformer terminal. The impulse  comprises the wide range of frequencies that are required and the resulting voltage or, if more  suitable, current pulse is measured at other terminals [19]. The response is sampled stored in  time domain and transformed to frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).    With SFRA, a frequency sweep of sinusoidal signals is injected to a transformer terminal. For  each frequency the injected signal is measured for reference and the response is measured at  another terminal of the same winding [20]-[22]. The difference between reference and response  is stored in modulus, argument form as magnitude and phase.    Many early practitioners tried impulse systems, and have continued to try them up to the present.  Though appealing in terms of speed, they have never been able to match the range, resolution or  repeatability of sweep methods and continue to reject impulse methods.',\n",
       " 'Objectives of Present Research': 'This work aims at applying FRA technique for faulty or age-old power transformers in  Bangladesh power sectors on site so that if any mechanical deformation is suspected, those will  be sent to workshop for repairing. The present work focuses on the following:    1.   Developing a transfer function of a power transformer for Sweep Frequency  Response Analysis (SFRA) taking all practical constraints e.g. Leakage current,  Hysteresis loss, Eddy current loss etc. into account.    2.   To overview the existing methods for detection of mechanical displacement in  transformers.     3.   Implementation of Cross Correlation Co-Efficient (CCF) analysis technique to  find out dissimilarity of the response signals got from different phases of a power  transformer.    4.   Successful prediction of the mechanical displacements or deformations which  have taken place in core or coils of a power transformer.     4    5.   Validation of theoretical prediction by fault detection in real damaged transformer  using CCF model.    Outcome of the work will be that the prediction about the physical position of the active part of a  transformer where the deformation has occurred exactly will be possible.',\n",
       " 'Organization of the Thesis': 'The presentation of the material studied in the present work is organized as follows:    Chapter 1 presents the review of the literature, objectives of the thesis along with the thesis  organization.    Chapter 2 discusses the basic principle and construction details of power transformer according  with transformer equivalent circuit representation taking all practical loss conditions into  account. Causes of different types of transformer faults as well as basic tests for transformer to  detect these faults have been elaborated at the last portion of this chapter.    Chapter 3 contains a brief description of Sweep Frequency Response Analysis (SFRA) technique  for detection of mechanical deformation in transformer. The response measurement procedure  and transfer function analysis for transformer has been described at the first portion of this  chapter. Then the standard response from different types of windings has been represented  followed by the response analysis bands recommended by IEEE professional experts.     Chapter 4 introduces an effective statistical parameter, Cross Correlation Co-Efficient (CCF)  which is used frequently in signal analysis to determine similarity between different traces. The  MATLAB code which has been developed in this work to calculate CCF between different  SFRA curves, has been described at the last point of this chapter.  5    Chapter 5 is based on fault detection in power transformers through traditional method using  SFRA technique. In this chapter, mechanical deformations in three different power transformers  of 230 kV and 132 kV has been detected using experts in view method.    Chapter 6 represents the effectiveness of the proposal to use CCF parameter to detect mechanical  faults in power transformer successfully. Through three case studies, CCF has been calculated  between different SFRA traces from the power transformers. Depending on the value of CCF,  the type and location of the deformation or faults which have taken place in transformer has been  predicted. After that, opening the top cover of the transformer, by physical inspection, position  and types of deformation has been noted to ensure the effectivity of the new proposal and  technique.    Chapter 7 contains the ending discussion as well as scope of future development of this  technique.',\n",
       " 'Construction Details': 'The main parts of a transformer are:  \\uf0b7   Transformer core   \\uf0b7   Transformer Windings   \\uf0b7   Transformer Tank and Radiators    2.2.1 Transformer Core  Every transformer has a core which is surrounded by windings. The core (Figure 2.2) is made out  of special cold rolled grain oriented silicon sheet steel laminations. The special silicon steel  ensures low hysteresis losses. The silicon steel laminations also ensure high resistively of core  material which results in low eddy currents. In order to reduce eddy current losses, the  laminations are kept as thin as possible. The thickness of the laminations is usually around 0.27  to 0.35 mm. The transformer cores construction is of two types, viz, core type and shell type. In  core type transformers, the windings are wound around the core, while in shell type transformers,  the core is constructed around the windings. The shell type transformers provide a low reactance  path for the magnetic flux, while the core type transformer has a high leakage flux and hence  higher reactance.    The ideal shape for the section of the core is a circle, as this  would mean no wastage of space between the core and  windings, except the space taken by the insulation between  laminations. A perfectly circular section of core would mean  varying dimensions for each successive lamination, which may  not be economical. A compromise is therefore struck and a  stepped core (four or six steps) construction is normally  preferred. The net sectional area is calculated from the  dimensions of the various sections and giving due allowance  for the insulation thickness. The yoke section is arranged  similar to the limb section. To make the best use of the grain oriented silicon steel it is necessary  Figure 2.2: Transformer Core  8    that the flux run parallel to the direction of the rolling for as much of the magnetic path as  possible [13]. This is achieved by selecting identical cross-section and shape for core and yoke  sections and having mitered corners. The materials used are such as to give low hysteretic losses,  for a particular flux density. These are dependant on weight of material used and design flux  density. In case a low flux density is employed, the weight of material increases, which in turn  also leads to increase in length of mean turn of transformer coil. Both these aspects result in  increase in losses. Similarly, the eddy current loss depends on the quality of material thickness of  laminations and the flux density employed.     The limb laminations in small transformers are held together by stout webbing tape or by  suitably spaced glass fiber bends. The use of insulated bolts passing through the limb laminations  has been discontinued due to number of instances of core bolt failures. The top and bottom  mitered yokes are interleaved with the limbs and are clamped by steel sections held together by  insulated yoke bolts. The steel frames clamping the top and bottom yokes are held together by  vertical tie bolts.    2.2.2 Transformer Winding  The primary and secondary windings in a core type transformer are of the concentric type only,  while in case of shell type transformer these could be of sand-witched type as well. The  concentric (Figure 2.3) windings are normally constructed in any of the following types  depending on the size and application of the transformer:   \\uf0b7   Cross over Type   \\uf0b7   Helical Type  \\uf0b7   Continuous Disc Type    Cross-over type winding is normally employed where rated currents are up-to about 20 Amperes  or so. In this type of winding, each coil consists of number of layers having number of turns per  layer. The conductor being a round wire or strip insulated with a paper covering. It is normal  practice to provide one or two extra lavers of paper insulation between lavers. Further, the   insulation between lavers is wrapped round the end turns of the lavers there by assisting to keep  the whole coil compact. The complete winding consists of a number of coils connected in series.  The inside end of a coil is connected to the outside end of adjacent coil. Insulation blocks are  provided between adjacent coils to ensure free circulation of oil.     9    In helical winding, the coil consists of a number of rectangular strips wound in parallel racially  such that each separate turn occupies the total radial depth of the winding. Each turn is wound on  a number of key spacers which form the vertical oil duct and each turn or group of turns is  spaced by radial keys sectors. This ensures free circulation of oil in horizontal and vertical  direction. This type of coil construction is normally adopted for low voltage windings where the  magnitude of current is comparatively large.      The continuous disc type of windings consists of number of Discs  wound from a single wire or number of strips in parallel. Each disc  consists of number of turns, wound radically, over one another. The  conductor passes uninterruptedly from one disc to another. With  multiple-strip conductor, Transpositions are made at regular  intervals to ensure uniform resistance and length of conductor. The  discs are wound on an insulating cylinder spaced from it by strips  running the whole length of the cylinder and separated from one  another by hard pressboard sectors keyed to the vertical strips. This  ensures free circulation of oil in horizontal and vertical direction  and provides efficient heat dissipation from windings to the oil. The  whole coil structure is mechanically sound and capable of resisting  the most enormous short circuit forces.      The insulation of the windings comprises of  insulating cylinders between LV windings and  core and between HV winding (Figure 2.4). Also  insulating barriers are provided where necessary  between adjacent limbs, in some cases and  between core yoke and coils.   The leads from top  and bottom end of windings and from such  tapings, as may be provided are brought out to a  few centimeters length only. The electrical  connection from these leads to the terminals or  bushings consist of either copper rod or strips depending on the current to be carried. Copper  rods are insulated with Bakelite tubes and supported by cleats. Which in turn, are supported from  the vertical tie rods passing through the top and bottom yoke clamp. When copper strips are used  for low voltage leads no insulation need to be provided, except the cleats, which hold the strip in  position. The strips are however wrapped with linen or varnish cloth at the point where it passes  through the leads. Leads from tapings are brought out (Figure 2.5) to a point just below the top  oil and so arranged that tapings may be readily changed by means of off-load Tap changer.  Figure 2.3: Transformer Coil  Figure 2.4: Insulation of Transformer  10      Figure 2.5: Core-Coil assembled active part  2.2.3  Transformer Tank  Transformer tanks commonly used are of the following types:   \\uf0b7   Plain sheet steel tank  \\uf0b7   Sheet steel tank with external cooling tubes  \\uf0b7   Radiator tanks  \\uf0b7   Tanks with corrugated wall panels    Plain sheet steel tanks (Figure 2.6) are used where the size of the tank provides adequate cooling  surface to dissipate the heat generated on account of losses inside the transformer. Normally  transformers up-to 50KVA could be manufactured without external cooling tubes. For  transformers of higher rating, tanks are constructed with external cooling tubes to provide  additional surface for heat dissipation. The cooling tubes could be circular or elliptical. Elliptical  tubes with smaller width are employed where one of the sides of the transformer is fully  occupied by on load tap changer. This ensures more tubes on the given surface thereby providing  more area for heat dissipation. In larger tanks, stiffeners are also provided on the sides of the  tank to prevent bulging of the tank under oil pressure. The tubes are welded on the inside of the  tank, while all other joints are welded both, inside and outside.    11    Large size transformers, above 5 MVA rating are  normally provided with detachable Radiator banks  to provide required cooling surface. The radiator  bank consists of series of elliptical tubes or a  pressed steel plate assembly welded into top and  bottom headers. The radiator bank is bolted on to  the tank wall and two isolating valves are fitted into  the oil inlet and outlet. In case of very large  transformers,  even  detachable  radiator  banks  mounted onto the tank walls do not provide  adequate cooling surface. In such cases, separate  self supporting coolers are provided which are  connected to the main transformer through large detachable pipes. This type of arrangement is  good for naturally cooled transformers, as well as, for forced cooled transformers. Forced air  cooling could be provided by means of suitable fans located below the cooler banks. Similarly,  forced oil cooling could be provided by installing an oil pump in the return cold oil pipe  connecting the main transformer tank to the cooler bank. For outdoor transformers, the  transformer has to be water-tight. For this purpose, the cover bolts are closely spaced and a  substantial tank flange of ample width is provided. Further a Neoprene bonded cork gasket is  provided between the tank flange and the cover. The bushing insulators are selected considering  the maximum system voltages encountered in the system and pollution conditions prevailing at  site. The joints are made water-tight by use of Neoprene bonded cork gaskets.',\n",
       " '2.3  Basic Principle': \"The transformer is based on two principles: firstly, that an electric current can produce a  magnetic field (electromagnetism) and secondly that a changing magnetic field within a coil of  wire induces a voltage across the ends of the coil (electromagnetic induction). By changing the  current in the primary coil, it changes the strength of its magnetic field; since the changing  magnetic field extends into the secondary coil, a voltage is induced across the secondary.    A simplified transformer design is shown in Figure 2.7. A current passing through the primary  coil creates a magnetic field. The primary and secondary coils are wrapped around a core of very  high magnetic permeability, such as iron; this ensures that most of the magnetic field lines  produced by the primary current are within the iron and pass through the secondary coil as well  as the primary coil.  Figure 2.6: Transformer Tank  12      Figure 2.7: An ideal step-down transformer showing magnetic flux in the core  The voltage induced across the secondary coil may be calculated from Faraday's law of  induction, which states that:  V S  = N S   ùëëùúë ùëëùë°\",\n",

       " 'magnetizing current': '; since the ideal core has been assumed to have near-zero  reluctance, the magnetizing current is negligible, although still required to create the magnetic  field. The simplified description above neglects several practical factors, in particular the  primary current required to establish a magnetic field in the core, and the contribution to the field  due to current in the secondary circuit.        14',\n",
       " 'Practical Considerations': '2.4.1 Leakage Flux  The ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the  turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside  the windings. Such flux is termed',\n",
       " 'leakage flux': ', and results in leakage inductance in series with  the mutually coupled transformer windings. Leakage results in energy being alternately stored in  and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a  power loss, but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage to fail to be  directly proportional to the primary, particularly under heavy load. Transformers are therefore  normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.    Figure 2.9: Leakage flux of a transformer    However, in some applications, leakage can be a desirable property, and long magnetic paths, air  gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may be deliberately introduced to a transformer\\'s design to limit  the short-circuit current it will supply. Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that  exhibit negative resistance, such as electric arcs, mercury vapor lamps, and neon signs; or for  safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as electric arc welders. Air  gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency  transformers in circuits that have a direct current flowing through the windings.    15    2.4.2 Energy Losses  An ideal transformer would have no energy losses and would be 100% efficient. In practical  transformers energy is dissipated in the windings, core, and surrounding structures. Larger  transformers are generally more efficient, and those rated for electricity distribution usually  perform better than 98%. Experimental transformers using superconducting windings have  achieved efficiencies of 99.85%. While the increase in efficiency is small, when applied to large  heavily-loaded transformers the annual savings in energy losses is significant.    A small transformer, such as a plug-in \"wall-wart\" or power adapter type used for low-power  consumer electronics, may be no more than 85% efficient, with considerable loss even when not  supplying any load. Though individual power loss is small, the aggregate losses from the very  large number of such devices are coming under increased scrutiny. The losses vary with load  current, and may be expressed as \"no-load\" or \"full-load\" loss. Winding resistance dominates  load losses, whereas hysteresis and eddy currents losses contribute to over 99% of the no-load  loss. The no-load loss can be significant, meaning that even an idle transformer constitutes a  drain on an electrical supply, which encourages development of low-loss transformers.    Transformer losses are divided into losses in the windings, termed copper loss, and those in the  magnetic circuit, termed iron loss. Losses in the transformer arise from:  \\uf0b7   Winding resistance   Current flowing through the windings causes resistive heating of the conductors. At  higher frequencies, skin effect and proximity effect create additional winding resistance  and losses.  \\uf0b7   Hysteresis losses   Each time the magnetic field is reversed, a small amount of energy is lost due to  hysteresis within the core. For a given core material, the loss is proportional to the  frequency and is a function of the peak flux density to which it is subjected.   \\uf0b7   Eddy currents   Ferromagnetic materials are also good conductors, and a solid core made from such a  material also constitutes a single short-circuited turn throughout its entire length. Eddy  currents therefore circulate within the core in a plane normal to the flux, and are  responsible for resistive heating of the core material. The eddy current loss is a complex  function of the square of supply frequency and Inverse Square of the material thickness.   16    \\uf0b7   Magnetostriction   Magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material, such as the core, causes it to physically  expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field, an effect known as  magnetostriction. This produces the buzzing sound commonly associated with  transformers and in turn causes losses due to frictional heating in susceptible cores.  \\uf0b7   Mechanical losses   In addition to magnetostriction, the alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating  electromagnetic forces between the primary and secondary windings. These incite  vibrations within nearby metalwork, adding to the buzzing noise, and consuming a small  amount of power.  \\uf0b7   Stray losses   Leakage inductance is by itself lossless, since energy supplied to its magnetic fields is  returned to the supply with the next half-cycle. However, any leakage flux that intercepts  nearby conductive materials such as the transformer\\'s support structure will give rise to  Eddy currents and be converted to heat.',\n",

In practical situation, due to voltage difference between Primary and Secondary winding;  Primary winding turns and grounded tank body; Secondary winding turns and grounded tank  body; different turns of Primary and Secondary windings, capacitance develop between them.

       " '2.6 Causes of Internal Faults in Transformer': '2.6.1  External Short-Circuit  An external short-circuit of a transformer often results in severe damages on transformer  windings. The generating capacity in power distribution networks has increased over the years,  due to demands on more electrical power. This has lead to high short circuit capacity in modern  transmission networks, which implies increased stress on a transformer in event of an external  short circuit. Failure rate in case of a short circuit is 40% for transformers above 100 MVA  rating.   A short-circuit causes unidirectional pulsating forces that are proportional to the square of the  short-circuit current. This leads to severe stress on the windings and might cause damages.  19    Repeated inrush currents, especially due to frequent switching on the inner winding, are also  known to cause stresses that can lead to failure.   Examples of fault conditions:   o   Deformed, loosened, displaced or collapsed winding structure   o   Buckled hoops  o   Loosened clamping structure  o   Turn-to-turn fault caused by shifted windings (one winding passing over another  due to compressing forces)    2.6.2  Over-Voltage Surges  Lightning strikes and switching operations might cause very fast transient overvoltage, especially  when the input surge is equal to some of the transformers internal resonance frequencies. This  phenomenon is known to cause flashover from turn to core and between turns. Especially turn to  turn insulation is sensitive. Insulation damages can lead to Turn-to-turn fault. In severe cases  several turns might be welded in various combinations, resulting in lost turns.    2.6.3  Transportation  Incidents during transport of new or serviced transformers can cause damages to it‚Äòs internal  structure. Even if a minor damage occurs, such as a slight looseness in part of a winding, it can  lead to breakdown of the transformer e.g. at a future short-circuit current.    2.6.4  Seismic Events  Seismic events such as earthquakes can cause mechanical stress on transformers and cause  internal damages.',\n",
       " '2.7 Transformer Tests before Commissioning': '2.7.1  Ratio, Polarity and Phase relationship test  The ratio should be checked at all taps and between all the windings. Ratio is usually checked by  applying a single phase 230V (Approx) supply on the high voltage side and measuring the  20    voltage on the low voltage side at all tap positions. The measured voltage on LV side shall  conform to declining trend between tap (min) to tap (max) position for all phases.  Polarity and interphone connections are checked while measuring the ratio. This can be checked  by the Avometer method. The primary and secondary windings are connected together at points  indicated in sketch shown below. A low voltage three phase supply is then applied to the HV  terminals. Voltage measurements are then taken between various pairs of terminals as indicated  in the diagram.  Readings obtained should be the vector sum of the separate voltages of each  winding under consideration.    2.7.2  Insulation Resistance test  The insulation resistance between winding and earth should be measured with a good 2500/1000  Volts Megger and values should be compared to the test report values. It is preferable to have a  motor operated Megger and the readings taken after one minute from starting. Before measuring  the insulation resistance, it should be made sure that the bushings are cleaned thoroughly with  clean cotton cloth. The lead wires of the Meaggers should not have joints. They should also give  reading of more than maximum value readable on the Megger.    2.7.3  Magnetizing Current test  A three phase 415 Volts supply is given to the HV winding of the three phase transformer and  simultaneous current readings of the three phases are taken using low range AC ammeters of the  same accuracy class. Values should be recorded for the future reference.    2.7.4  Magnetic Balance test  A single phase supply of approximately 230 Volts is applied to one phase of HV winding and the  induced voltage on other two HV phases measured separately. Test voltage should be applied to  HV winding only. Applying voltage LV winding may induce abnormal high voltage in HV  winding which may prove hazardous. Tests should be carried out on all three phases.     When single phase supply is given to middle phase the   induced voltage measured on two  extreme phases should be approximately equal. If supply is given to one extreme phase induced  voltage on middle phase is expected to be substantially high than the other extreme phase. In  each test the sum of the induced voltages on other two phases would be within +/-5% of the  applied voltage.   230 Volts single phase supply be given between lines, if windings are delta  21    connected and induced voltages measured between the other two phases. Whereas supply is  given to line and neutral of one phase in case of star connected windings, induced voltages  should be measured between the line and neutral of other two phases.    2.7.5  Oil Sample test  Oil after filtration should meet the requirements as laid down under the clause specification.  However, to know the conditions the following preliminary tests can be carried out.

These four terminals can be divided into two unique pairs [6], [8], [19],  one pair for the input and the other pair for the output. These terminals can be modeled in a two- terminal pair or a two-port network configuration.

       " 'Response of Different Winding Type': 'Most people immediately think of winding measurements as being only associated with the high- voltage and the low-voltage windings. When considering SFRA measurements, winding  measurements realistically consist of five categories and not just two. The winding categories are  high-voltage, low-voltage, inter, series, and common.    Short circuit measurements made on one winding while short circuiting another winding are a  variation on inter-winding measurements. It should be noted that inter-winding measurement is  not a true winding measurement, but rather the transfer impedance between two windings. The  series and common winding measurements describe the SFRA application as it is applied to auto  transformers. Regardless, certain expectations can be made for each. These measurement types  produce some predictable characteristics and properties. Understanding these properties  minimize testing error and help to identify problems. The following expectations exist for each  of the following categories.    3.5.1 High-Voltage Winding  High-voltage winding measurements have greatest attenuation as compared to low voltage and  tertiary windings. Most traces start between ‚Äì30 dB and ‚Äì50 dB and are initially inductive. High- voltage windings are much larger in overall size, which contributes to greater complexity in its  distributive network. High-voltage winding measurements generally produce steeper resonances  and more of them as compared to its low-voltage counterpart. Figure 3.8 illustrates this feature.    Figure 3.8: High-Voltage Winding response  29    The traces shown in Figure 3.8 are from different test specimens. Both traces are from 230 kV  core-form transformers, however one trace is from a delta connected configuration and the other  is from a wye connected configuration.    3.5.2 Low-Voltage Winding    Low-voltage winding measurements have least attenuation as compared to the other categories.  Most traces start between ‚Äì5 dB and ‚Äì15 dB and are also initially inductive. This characteristic is  due to the low impedance property of the high current side of the transformer. The first peak  after the core resonance generally approaches ‚Äì5 dB to 0 dB and is concave and smooth. As  compared to the high-voltage winding response, the low-voltage winding fewer fluctuations and  is slight smoother. Figure 3.9 illustrates these features. Again, both traces in this figure are from  different transformers.     Figure 3.9: Low-Voltage Winding response    3.5.3 Inter Winding    Inter-winding measurements always start with high attenuation, between ‚Äì60 dB and ‚Äì90 dB,  and are capacitive. If electrostatic interference is present, it will show up at 60 Hz and at the  associated harmonics of 60 Hz during this measurement. Figure 3.10 illustrates these features.  These traces are very common; most inter-winding traces adhere to one of the basic shapes  shown below.   30      Figure 3.10: Inter Winding response  3.5.4 Complete Response   Figure 3.11 presents a high-voltage winding trace, a low-voltage winding trace, and an inter- winding trace together from a common test specimen. This illustrates their general   relationship.  It can be seen that the low-voltage winding has consistently lower attenuation then the high- voltage winding. Also, low-voltage winding is much smoother at higher frequencies. This  example was taken from a 10 MVA auxiliary transformer.    Figure 3.11: Complete Trace response      31',\n",
       " 'Response Analysis Bands': 'The interpretation of SFRA response takes some experience, but there are guidelines available  and some general conclusions can be made from known results.      It is useful to divide the frequency ranges to improve the analysis. The following definitions are  taken from a paper published at Cigr√© Session 2004 [10]:   \\uf0b7   Frequency <10 kHz: in this range phenomena linked with the transformer core and  magnetic circuits are found. The analysis in this range must take into consideration the  residual magnetization which can slightly modify the obtained response from one test to  the other. Detectable problems in this range are: coil faults, winding interruptions and  magnetic circuit problems.     \\uf0b7   Frequency in the range 5 kHz to 500 kHz: in this range phenomena linked with radial  relative geometrical movements between windings are detected.     \\uf0b7   Frequency > 200 kHz: in this range axial deformations of each single winding are  detectable.     For comparison a section from a document titled ‚ÄïFacilities Instructions, Standards and  Techniques ‚Äñ  from United States Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation [17].   ‚ÄïBy comparing future traces with baseline traces, the following can be noted. In general, the  traces will change shape and be distorted in the low frequency range (under 5,000 Hz) if there is  a core problem. The traces will be distorted and change shape in higher frequencies (above  10,000 Hz) if there is a winding problem. Changes of less than 3 decibels (dB) compared to  baseline traces are normal and within tolerances. From 5 Hz to 2 kilohertz (kHz), changes of + or  ‚Äì 3 dB (or more) can indicate shorted turns, open circuit, residual magnetism, or core movement.  From 50 Hz to 20 kHz +/- 3 dB (or more), change from baseline can indicate bulk movement of  windings relative to each other. From 500 Hz to 2 MHz, changes of +/- 3 dB (or more) can  indicate deformation within a winding. From 25 Hz to 10 MHz, changes of +/- 3 dB (or more)  can indicate problems with winding leads and/or test leads placement. The above diagnostics  come from the EuroDoble Client Committee after much testing experience and analysis. Note  that there is a great deal of overlap in frequencies, which can mean more than one diagnosis. ‚Äñ     32    The conclusion from comparing the definitions from the Cigr√© session 2004 and the Bureau of  Reclamation instruction is that the frequency limits are guiding values. The reason for the  variation is probably differences in statistical material, such as transformer ratings, transformer  types and the amount of tested units. Conclusions regarding test leads depend upon the test  equipment used.    Fig. 3.12 shows a typical response for a high voltage star connected winding. Different sub- bands are dominated [23] by different internal components of the transformer and are  subsequently more sensitive to different types of failures, as summarized in Table 3.1.        Figure 3.12: Frequency Analysis Bands    The method to define low, middle and high frequency ranges is however commonly accepted. A  commonly accepted conclusion (from experience) is that frequency shifts (also small ones)  between compared SFRA response curves is an indicator of serious fault conditions. Another  conclusion is that difference in attenuation below 3 dB is often the result of irrelevant causes,  and not an indication of serious damages.',\n",

       " 'Motivation for SFRA Measurement': 'There are two distinct environments for application of sweep frequency response measurement:  in the factory and in the field. In both cases the procedures and precautions used to generate a  good measurement are the same. However, there is a difference in motivation for the tests in  each category.    3.7.1 Factory Application  Reasons to use SFRA in a factory environment include:  a)   Quality assurance  b)   Baseline reference  c)   Relocation and commissioning preparation    Manufacturers are using SFRA as part of their quality program to ensure transformer production  is identical between units in a batch. The accuracy and repeatability of SFRA is the key to the  program; the range from 20 Hz to 2 MHz is required to diagnose variations related to the core,  the clamping structure, windings and leads.  34    An SFRA baseline can be produced in the factory when the transformer has been filled with oil  and dressed as part of the factory commissioning tests. Many customers now appreciate the  benefits of having a good baseline for SFRA measurements in the field when they need to  respond to an incident. These customers require an SFRA measurement as part of their  transformer purchase specification.    There are cases where a transformer is also tested in the factory without oil immediately prior to  transport to the customer site. Some utilities specify that the transformer is shipped with small  test bushings fitted to allow this test to take place. This allows the transformer to be tested as  soon as it arrives on site without costly dressing and oil processing procedures. SFRA is safe to  perform on a suitably prepared transformer without oil as the test is low voltage one.    3.7.2 Field Application  Reasons to use SFRA in a field environment include:  a)   Relocation and commissioning validation  b)   Post incident: lightning, fault, short circuit, seismic event etc    Once a transformer arrives on site after relocation it may be tested immediately, without oil if  required, for comparison with baseline references or with sister units. (The provision of small  test bushings prior to shipping aids in testing). This gives confidence in the mechanical integrity  of the unit prior to commissioning. Some utilities prefer to check the impact recorders after the  relocation and then, assuming no adverse impact recorder results are found, redo factory based  SFRA tests once the transformer is dressed and ready for commissioning.    After a close up fault, or as a result of concern about the transformer from, for example, rising  DGA levels, SFRA is a key tool in the engineer‚Äòs toolbox for diagnosing the health of the  transformer and its suitability for service. There is much to be gained in terms of information  about mechanical integrity from an SFRA measurement, which supports evidence from Power  Factor and Capacitance testing, Transformer Turns Ratio and Winding Resistance measurements.    Building a complete picture of the transformer from all available data is critical in making  engineering judgments about an individual unit. Returning an unhealthy unit to service may  prove catastrophic.  35',\n",
       " 'Fault Detection by SFRA': 'SFRA is able to detect a number of fault conditions, both mechanical and electrical. The main  application of SFRA is to detect mechanical faults, for which some are detectable by SFRA only  and some are useful to analyze both with SFRA and other methods for correlation.

In this method, response curve of the transformer is taken at the  manufacturing factory. Then after transportation or relocation at concern site, the response curve  is measured again. An experienced observer then examines the two curves for any significant  differences. Significant differences are usually understood to be:   a)   Changes to the shape of the curve   b)   The creation of new resonant frequencies or the elimination of existing resonant  frequencies   c)   Large shifts in existing resonant frequencies [9].     The main problem with these methods of comparison is that the expert‚Äòs opinion may lack both  objectivity and transparency. One way of addressing both problems is to note down all of the  resonant frequencies. This gives specific and transparent information on the number of  resonances that have been created or eliminated and how far any resonances may have shifted.

       " 'Case 1: 14 MVA, 33/11.6 kV, 3œÜ Power Transformer at 33 kV Substation': 'The subjected transformer was running at Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC). It is a  10/14 MVA, 33/11.6 kV (vector group - YNd11) power transformer manufactured by Brush  Transformers Ltd. (Loughborough, England) at 1991. Appendix A.4 gives more specific data.  Due to its age of 20 years, frequency response of this transformer was taken to predict its aging  effect. At first, test was carried on HV side keeping LV side open followed by LV side shorted.  Corresponding Bode Plot response has been shown in figure 6.1 and 6.2. CCF results are shown  in Table 6.2 and 6.3.

This may be due to core deformation as a result of axial stress  because the transformer is running for a long time (20 years). Again, poor matching at higher  region (400 kHz-1 MHz) indicates main coil deformation either by radial stress or by axial stress.  This deformation is more severe for A phase (Red phase).  57      Figure 6.3:  LV winding response (HV open)      Table 6.4: CCF of LV winding keeping HV open  Frequency Sub-band  CCF results  X1-X0, X2-X0  X2-X0, X3-X0  X3-X0, X1-X0  0 ‚Äì 2 kHz  0.8381  0.8325  0.9907  2 kHz ‚Äì 20 kHz  0.9943  0.9921  0.9936  20 kHz ‚Äì 400 kHz  0.9825  0.9867  0.9781  400 kHz ‚Äì 1 MHz  0.8493  0.9275  0.8027      From LV winding response (Figure 6.3) and corresponding CCF calculation (Table 6.4), the  previous assumption becomes stronger. Poor matching at low frequency region (0-2 kHz) and  high frequency region (400 kHz-1 MHz) again spans the prediction of core damage and main  winding movement firmly. After replacing the transformer from the system, it was dissected and  both the prediction became true. The corresponding core and coil of this transformer is shown in  figure 6.4 and 6.5.  58      Figure 6.4: The position of the fault in the Core structure        Figure 6.5: The damaged coil of HV A-phase (Red phase)      59',\n",

This indicates that the core of this transformer is very good  condition according with the core bolts and channels. But, very poor matching at the 20 kHz ‚Äì  400 kHz band indicates that high voltage coil is severely deformed or damaged specifically due  to radial force.
